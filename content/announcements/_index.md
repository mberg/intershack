## Intershack Welcome Cocktail - November 29

The Intershack Welcome Cocktail will be held at the Tower Bar on **Saturday November 29, from 4:00-6:00 PM**.

It is an opportunity to connect with old friends and meet new friends and hear about upcoming Intershack events.

**Please let us know by Friday November 14th** if you will be joining us so we can plan the food accordingly.

We look forward to seeing you at this event and future events throughout the season and here's hoping to a repeat of the 2024/2025 winter snow!
