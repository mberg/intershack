In the beginning, there was no Intershack - but there were several ski houses in the Jay Peak area. Many of the house members were from Commonwealth countries-England, Australia, New Zealand, India, etc., and were also members of the Overseas Canadian Club in Montreal.

The O.C. Club had been formed early in 1968 by about ten people, of whom Mike Olsen and Jack Wilson were the prime instigators. It was modeled after the club in London where newcomers to England socialized and, similarly, the Montreal Club was a place where recent arrivals to Canada could meet their compatriots and have a good time.

## The Beginning

Along came Omi Ohri of the Skiducers in Montgomery Village and Mike Olsen of The Establishment also in Montgomery Village, as well as Roy Clark and Eddie Bogomohny. They felt that the Jay Peak area was a bit too quiet and that it lacked the atmosphere they enjoyed at the O.C. Club. 

So, for the 1968-69 ski season, Omi decided that the area's houses should organize into a loose association and generate more fun for everyone. He and Mike felt that with the large number of people in the houses, a special rate for group members should be obtained from Jay Peak in appreciation of the regular business the house members were bringing to the hill. 

Signatures from 150 or so members of these houses were obtained and presented to Jay Peak, and ticket reductions were obtained.

## Evolution Through the Decades

From those humble beginnings in 1968, Intershack has grown and evolved while maintaining its core mission of bringing people together for mountain adventures and social activities. What started as a loose association of ski house members has become a thriving community that spans generations.

## Today's Intershack

Today, Intershack continues the tradition established over 56 years ago, organizing events throughout the year and maintaining our special relationship with Jay Peak Resort. We've expanded beyond just skiing to include golf tournaments, social gatherings, and community service activities, all while preserving the spirit of fun and camaraderie that our founders envisioned.
